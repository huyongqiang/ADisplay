WARNING:

Clicking "ESC" button can exit the application.

The "images" folder is to save images which will display on the screen.
DO NOT have any Chinese characters for the image's name!!! So just to use any normal English characters will be fine.

If you want to modify the interval time, enter the "settings" folder and open the "setting.xml" by the "notepad.exe".
The number between the <interval> is for the time. Feel free to modify it that is more than 5.
