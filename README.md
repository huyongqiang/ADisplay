# How to use it

1. Download the "exe" folder.
2. Open the "ADisplay.exe" file.

# Warning

- Clicking "ESC" button can exit the application.

- The "images" folder is to save images which will display on the screen. 

- DO NOT have any non-English characters for the image's name!!! So just to use any normal English characters will be fine.

- If you want to modify the interval time, enter the "settings" folder and open the "setting.xml" by the "notepad.exe". The number between the &lt;interval> is for the time. Feel free to modify it that is more than 5.
